## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a React application using **React Router** with four main pages:

1. **Home Page** – The main landing page of the application.  
2. **About Page** – A page providing information about the app or developer.  
3. **User Info Page** – A page displaying user-related information.  
4. **Not Found Page** – A fallback page for any undefined routes.

This project focuses on **navigating between pages** efficiently using **React Router** and handling routes that do not exist.
